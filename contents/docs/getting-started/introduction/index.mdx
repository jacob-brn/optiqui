`Optiq UI` is based on shadcn/ui, so you need to install it before using any of our sections.

## Installation

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Create new project">
    Run the `init` command to create new nextjs project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="You are done.">
      Now you can copy and use our sections in your new project.
  </StepperItem>
